# ABC-Premier-League

Provided was a file with the teams to participate in the ABC Premier League

Provided file is found at: Hackathon/teams.csv

Task was to use the teams to simulate the fixtures enough for all teams to play for 2 legs.

My team and I used files to be able to achieve this all found in the Hackathon folder and the final fixtures is a text file named Final Fixtures.txt in the folder Hackathon.

The display in Final Fixtures.txt was the final output that was also logged to the console images found at Images folder.
